you have to maintain an underground bunker

the outside world is dark, empty and unapologetic


the player is living in the bunker and has to do basic chores to do

like:

- maintain the aquarium, as it provides oxygen in the bunker
- check for radio signals sent by, hopefully, other humans
- fix the ground level antenna



mechanical ideas:

- Game uses users computer real time in game
