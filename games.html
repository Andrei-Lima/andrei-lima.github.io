            <p>Uncolour was made in 14 October 2021 with the idea of making a game with only shades of gray, there's not much to this game other than this level.</p>
            <p>The idea was that I, the game developer was supposed to teach you how to play, and later in the game I was the villain all along, with some dubious moments so the player could figure it out himself.</p>
            <p>I don't plan on continuing this project as of late, but maybe when inspiration strikes i will give it a chance.</p>

            <p>People was an awesome project to work on, but with time the bad programming made me go away from it, people was supposed to be an arg with a hidden story (I was inspired by petscop)</p>
            <p>i really love the atmosphere/musics I was able to create for this game, but in the process of trying to recover some of the code, fix bugs, etc. it made the game very junky</p>
            <p>Unfortunately I don't have any footage of the game simply because the game won't compile in GameMaker, for some reason, these screenshots were in a backup.</p>
